# PML Assignment 2: Credit Default Prediction

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict credit default risk using structured financial data. It encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and generating predictions for unseen data.

## 📁 Project Structure

├── train.csv                         # Processed training data

└── BinaryFolder/                     # Directory for serialized models or outputs
```

## 🧠 Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**: The raw data is cleaned and split into training and testing sets (`train.csv` and `test.csv`).
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to train on the processed data.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using appropriate metrics to ensure reliability.
- **Prediction**: Applies the trained model to `CreditDefault_Mystery.csv` to predict default risks, outputting results to `CreditDefault_Predictions.csv`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mjwanless/PML-Assignment-2.git
   cd PML-Assignment-2
   ```



2. **Install dependencies**:

   Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. If a `requirements.txt` file is provided, you can install dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If not, manually install required packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

### Usage

1. **Train the model**:

   Run the training script to train and evaluate the model:

   ```bash
   python TrainingScript.py
   ```
   This will process the data, train the model, and save evaluation metrics and visualizations in the `Visualizations/` directory.

2. **Generate predictions**:

   Use the production script to generate predictions on the mystery dataset:

   ```bash
   python Production.py
   ```
   Predictions will be saved to `CreditDefault_Predictions.csv`.

## 📊 Visualizations

The `Visualizations/` directory contains plots and graphs that provide insights into data distributions, model performance, and feature importance.
